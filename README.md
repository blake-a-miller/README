## **Introduction**

>The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a representation of the networking framework that serves to direct the protocols that make the internet what it is.
 The OSI Model consists of 7 layers which depict the processes taking place when a user interacts with a machine (computer), and then the result of that interaction. 
 The OSI Model helps us understand how the machines work, their capabilities and limitations, and furthermore, the machines potential. 

>This tutorial was made with the intent of providing a brief and enjoyable way to learn about the OSI Model! This tutorial was made for people of any and all ages.
 An interest to learn will be largely helpful. :wink:

## **History**

A brief history of the OSI Model can be found by clicking [here.](https://youtu.be/uPIZs6k6DRo) (00:00 - 03:27)

Pretty interesting stuff right? ðŸŒž


## **Layers**

>As mentioned previously, the OSI Model is made up of layers. **7** layers to be exact.   
  
>>In order from top to bottom, here is a list of the 7 layers that make up the OSI Model:  
  > 1. Physical Layer (bottom layer)
  > 2. Data Link Layer
  > 3. Network Layer
  > 4. Transport Layer
  > 5. Session Layer
  > 6. Presentation Layer
  > 7. Application Layer (top layer)

### **The Physical Layer**

The Physical layer is responsible for transmitting data bits using electrical pulses and signals. That is, taking the data and breaking it down into its rawest form
so that it may be transported. 
The easiest way to explain the physical layer is through familiraztion with the components that it includes.
Several networking components like ethernet cables, network interface cards (NICs), and hubs.
