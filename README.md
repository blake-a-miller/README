## **Introduction**

>The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a networking framework that serves to direct the protocols that make the internet what it is.
 The OSI Model consists of 7 layers which depict the processes taking place when a user interacts with a machine (computer), and then the result of that interaction. 
 The OSI Model helps us understand how the machines work, their capabilities and limitations, and furthermore, the machines potential. 

>This tutorial was made with the intent of providing a brief and enjoyable way to learn about the OSI Model! This tutorial was made for people of any and all ages.
 All that's needed is an interest to learn.
