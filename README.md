## **Introduction**

>The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a representation of the networking framework that serves to direct the protocols that make the internet what it is.
 The OSI Model consists of 7 layers which depict the processes taking place when a user interacts with a machine (computer), and then the result of that interaction. 
 The OSI Model helps us understand how the machines work, their capabilities and limitations, and furthermore, the machines potential. 

>This tutorial was made with the intent of providing a brief and enjoyable way to learn about the OSI Model! This tutorial was made for people of any and all ages.
 An interest to learn will be largely helpful. :wink:

## **History**

Pretty interesting stuff right? ðŸŒž


## **Layers**

>As mentioned previously, the OSI Model is made up of layers. **7** layers to be exact.   
  
>>In order from top to bottom, here is a list of the 7 layers that make up the OSI Model:  
  * 1. Physical Layer
    2. Data Link Layer
    3. Network Layer
    4. Transport Layer
    5. Session Layer
    6. Presentation Layer
    7. Application Layer
  
>Another way that ice cream is so versatile is the amount of flavors it is made with.
