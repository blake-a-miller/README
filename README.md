## **Introduction**

>The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a representation of the networking framework that serves to direct the protocols that make the internet what it is.
 The OSI Model consists of 7 layers which depict the processes taking place when a user interacts with a machine (computer), and then the result of that interaction. 
 The OSI Model helps us understand how the machines work, their capabilities and limitations, and furthermore, the machines potential. 

>This tutorial was made with the intent of providing a brief and enjoyable way to learn about the OSI Model! This tutorial was made for people of any and all ages.
 An interest to learn will be largely helpful. :wink:

## **History**

A brief history of the OSI Model can be found by clicking [here.](https://youtu.be/uPIZs6k6DRo) (00:00 - 03:27)

Pretty interesting stuff right? ðŸŒž


## **Layers**

>As mentioned previously, the OSI Model is made up of layers. **7** layers to be exact.   
  
>>In order from top to bottom, here is a list of the 7 layers that make up the OSI Model:  
  > 1. Physical Layer (bottom layer)
  > 2. Data Link Layer
  > 3. Network Layer
  > 4. Transport Layer
  > 5. Session Layer
  > 6. Presentation Layer
  > 7. Application Layer (top layer)

### **The Physical Layer**

Here is a list of my favorite ice cream flavors from Ben & Jerry's, number 1 being my all time favorite:
1. Americone Dream
2. Half Baked
3. Milk & Cookies
